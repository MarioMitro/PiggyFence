For project to work you need to instal Unity FirebaseDatabase plugin.

You can find the plugin here: https://firebase.google.com/download/unity


If you want testing different fences in the project you can do so with scriptable object TestFenceInfo
(you can find him in Assets/CustomAssets), insinde is already few examples of different fences that I used for
debugging so you can use them or create new one. 
DON'T FORGET to add this object to GridManager and DatabaseManager objects (you can find them in MainScene under Managers object) as variable Fence Info.


I completed this project in 12-14 hours.
